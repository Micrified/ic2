# Oscillator Design Project

This project consists of the design of an integrated circuit that performs an oscillating function. The components are:

1. A Schmitt trigger
2. A frequency doubler
3. A frequency divider

The Schmitt trigger is designed to oscillate at 3GHz, which is then multiplied by the frequency doubler to 6GHz, and finally divided by three back down to 2GHz, the minimum acceptable frequency for the project.

All project files are for use with Spectre/Virtuso (whatever it's called) in Cadence.
